# QuantumMind: A Hypothetical Cognitive Simulation Framework

QuantumMind is a Python-based framework designed to explore and simulate aspects of human cognition using computational models. While the project does not claim to replicate actual quantum processing in the brain (a field still under heavy research), it leverages principles of distributed computation and emergent behavior to model cognitive processes like memory retrieval, decision-making, and pattern recognition. The framework aims to provide a flexible and extensible platform for researchers and developers interested in building and experimenting with computational cognitive architectures. It encourages the exploration of novel algorithms and data structures inspired by the complex interconnectivity and dynamic nature of biological neural networks.

This project distinguishes itself by employing a modular architecture, allowing users to easily swap out different cognitive modules and experiment with their interactions. Instead of focusing on a single, monolithic cognitive model, QuantumMind promotes the development of specialized modules that can be combined and configured to represent different cognitive functions. Furthermore, the framework emphasizes the importance of emergent behavior. By creating a system with many interacting components, it seeks to observe complex and potentially unexpected cognitive capabilities arising from the interactions between these components, mirroring the intricate dynamics observed in biological brains. The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of how complex behavior can emerge from relatively simple rules and interactions at the individual component level.

QuantumMind provides a robust foundation for simulating cognitive processes. The framework is built with extensibility in mind, enabling researchers to implement their own cognitive models and integrate them seamlessly into the existing architecture. By offering a clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces, QuantumMind simplifies the process of building, testing, and comparing different cognitive models. This facilitates reproducible research and allows for a more collaborative approach to understanding the computational underpinnings of human cognition. The project also includes tools for visualizing and analyzing the simulation results, enabling researchers to gain valuable insights into the inner workings of their cognitive models.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Cognitive Architecture:** The framework utilizes a modular design, allowing developers to create and integrate independent cognitive modules. Each module represents a specific cognitive function (e.g., working memory, attention, perception) and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces. For example, a developer could implement a custom memory module using a specific data structure and then easily integrate it with the decision-making module.
*   **Distributed Computation Paradigm:** QuantumMind emphasizes distributed computation, where cognitive processes are simulated by a network of interacting agents. This approach allows for the exploration of emergent behavior and parallel processing, mimicking the distributed nature of biological brains. Each agent can represent a neuron, a cognitive process, or a more abstract computational unit.
*   **Flexible Configuration System:** The framework provides a flexible configuration system that allows users to customize the behavior of individual modules and the overall architecture. This includes parameters such as learning rates, connection weights, and activation thresholds. Configuration files can be written in YAML or JSON format, allowing for easy modification and reproducibility.
*   **Event-Driven Simulation Engine:** QuantumMind employs an event-driven simulation engine that allows for efficient and asynchronous execution of cognitive processes. This enables the simulation of complex cognitive tasks with a large number of interacting agents. Events can represent stimuli, internal signals, or actions performed by agents.
*   **Visualization and Analysis Tools:** The framework includes tools for visualizing and analyzing the simulation results, allowing researchers to gain insights into the behavior of the cognitive model. This includes tools for plotting activity patterns, visualizing network connections, and analyzing statistical properties of the simulation.
*   **Python API:** A well-documented Python API facilitates the creation of custom cognitive models and their integration into the framework. The API provides classes and functions for defining modules, creating agents, specifying connections, and running simulations. The API supports both procedural and object-oriented programming styles.
*   **Extensible Model Library:** The framework includes a library of pre-built cognitive modules that can be used as building blocks for creating more complex cognitive models. These modules implement common cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and decision-making. Developers can extend this library by adding their own custom modules.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.8+:** The core programming language for the framework, providing flexibility, readability, and a rich ecosystem of libraries.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical computation, providing efficient array operations and mathematical functions for simulating cognitive processes.
*   **SciPy:** Utilized for scientific computing, including statistical analysis, signal processing, and optimization algorithms.
*   **NetworkX:** Employed for representing and analyzing cognitive networks, allowing for the exploration of connectivity patterns and information flow.
*   **PyYAML or JSON:** Used for configuration management, allowing users to easily customize the behavior of the framework.
*   **Matplotlib or Seaborn:** For visualization and plotting of simulation results, enabling researchers to gain insights into the behavior of the cognitive model.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumMind.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd QuantumMind
3.  Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    python3 -m venv venv
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    On Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
    On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
5.  Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Configuration

The framework uses configuration files to specify the parameters of the simulation. These files can be written in YAML or JSON format. You can specify the configuration file to use by setting the `QUANTUMMIND_CONFIG` environment variable. For example:

On Linux/macOS:
export QUANTUMMIND_CONFIG=config.yaml

On Windows:
set QUANTUMMIND_CONFIG=config.yaml

The configuration file should contain the following parameters:

*   `simulation_duration`: The duration of the simulation in simulation time units.
*   `module_configurations`: A dictionary specifying the configuration for each cognitive module. Each module configuration should include the following parameters:
    *   `module_class`: The name of the Python class that implements the module.
    *   `module_parameters`: A dictionary of parameters that are passed to the module's constructor.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to run a simple simulation:

First, create a configuration file named `config.yaml` with the following content:

simulation_duration: 1000
module_configurations:
  memory_module:
    module_class: MemoryModule
    module_parameters:
      capacity: 100
  decision_module:
    module_class: DecisionModule
    module_parameters:
      threshold: 0.8

Next, create a Python script named `main.py` with the following content:

from quantummind.core import Simulation
from quantummind.modules import MemoryModule, DecisionModule

class MemoryModule:
  def __init__(self, capacity):
    self.capacity = capacity
    # Initialization logic here

  def process_input(self, input_data):
    # Memory processing logic here
    pass

class DecisionModule:
  def __init__(self, threshold):
    self.threshold = threshold
    # Initialization logic here

  def process_input(self, input_data):
    # Decision-making logic here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
  simulation = Simulation(config_file="config.yaml")
  simulation.run()

To run the simulation, execute the following command:

python main.py
