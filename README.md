# QuantumMind: Evolving Latent Space for Generative AI

A framework for evolving latent space traversal via adversarial autoencoders and diffusion bridges to synthesize high-quality generative AI artifacts.

This repository contains the implementation of QuantumMind, a novel approach to generative AI artifact synthesis. QuantumMind combines the strengths of adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) and diffusion bridges to intelligently navigate and evolve the latent space, resulting in more diverse and high-quality generated outputs. The project addresses the limitations of traditional generative models that often struggle with mode collapse and limited exploration of the latent space. By utilizing AAEs, QuantumMind learns a structured and regularized latent representation of the data. Subsequently, diffusion bridges are employed to smoothly interpolate between different points in the latent space, fostering the discovery of novel and meaningful variations. This iterative process, guided by evolutionary algorithms, allows for the targeted refinement of the latent space traversal strategy, ultimately leading to the generation of superior AI artifacts. QuantumMind offers a powerful and flexible tool for researchers and developers seeking to enhance the performance of generative models across a wide range of applications, including image synthesis, audio generation, and text-to-image translation.

QuantumMind provides a robust and adaptable architecture for exploring the possibilities of latent space manipulation. It goes beyond simple random sampling by introducing a sophisticated evolutionary strategy to guide the discovery process. The framework allows users to define custom fitness functions that evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated artifacts. These fitness functions are then used to drive the evolutionary process, iteratively refining the latent space traversal strategy. This adaptive approach enables QuantumMind to effectively optimize for specific generation goals, leading to outputs that are both creative and aligned with user-defined objectives. The project includes modular components that can be easily customized and extended, allowing users to tailor the framework to their specific needs.

The core innovation lies in the synergistic combination of AAEs and diffusion bridges, coupled with an evolutionary algorithm. The AAE ensures a well-behaved latent space, making it amenable to targeted exploration. The diffusion bridge facilitates smooth transitions between latent space points, preventing abrupt changes in the generated outputs. Finally, the evolutionary algorithm provides a systematic and data-driven approach to optimizing the latent space traversal, ensuring that the generator effectively discovers and exploits the most promising regions of the latent space. This combination of techniques results in a powerful and flexible framework for generative AI artifact synthesis.

## Key Features

*   **Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) based Latent Space Learning:** Utilizes an AAE architecture to learn a structured and regularized latent representation of the input data, promoting smooth and interpretable traversal. The AAE consists of an encoder network that maps input data to the latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the input from the latent representation. An adversarial network is trained to ensure that the latent distribution matches a predefined prior distribution (e.g., Gaussian), facilitating efficient exploration.

*   **Diffusion Bridge for Latent Space Interpolation:** Employs diffusion bridges to generate smooth and coherent transitions between different points in the latent space. The diffusion bridge is implemented using a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that gradually transforms one latent vector into another, creating a continuous path in the latent space. This process ensures that the generated outputs exhibit gradual and controlled variations.

*   **Evolutionary Algorithm for Latent Space Traversal Optimization:** Integrates an evolutionary algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm) to optimize the latent space traversal strategy. The algorithm iteratively refines the path through the latent space, guided by a user-defined fitness function that evaluates the quality and diversity of the generated outputs.

*   **Customizable Fitness Functions:** Allows users to define custom fitness functions to evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated artifacts. These fitness functions can incorporate various metrics, such as image quality assessments, semantic similarity scores, and aesthetic evaluations.

*   **Modular Architecture:** The framework is designed with a modular architecture, allowing users to easily customize and extend the components. This includes the ability to replace the AAE with other latent variable models, modify the diffusion bridge implementation, and experiment with different evolutionary algorithms.

*   **Support for Multiple Data Types:** The framework supports a variety of data types, including images, audio, and text. The specific AAE and diffusion bridge architectures can be adapted to suit the characteristics of the input data.

*   **Checkpointing and Logging:** Includes comprehensive checkpointing and logging mechanisms to track the progress of the training and evolutionary processes. Checkpoints allow users to resume training from a specific point, while logs provide valuable insights into the behavior of the model and the effectiveness of the evolutionary strategy.

## Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for implementing the entire framework. Python's rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks makes it ideal for developing complex AI applications.

*   **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Deep learning framework used for building and training the AAE and diffusion bridge models. Users can select either TensorFlow or PyTorch based on their preference and familiarity.

*   **NumPy:** Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python, used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations.

*   **SciPy:** Library for scientific computing in Python, used for various signal processing and optimization tasks.

*   **Deap (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python):** A framework for evolutionary computation, used to implement the genetic algorithm for optimizing latent space traversal.

*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Libraries for data visualization, used for visualizing the latent space, generated artifacts, and training progress.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    `git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/QuantumMind.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    `cd QuantumMind`

3.  Create a virtual environment (optional but highly recommended):
    `python3 -m venv venv`
    `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/macOS)
    `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

4.  Install the required dependencies:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` (This file should list all dependencies like tensorflow or torch, numpy, scipy, deap, matplotlib, seaborn)

5.  Verify the installation by running a simple test script (e.g., `test_installation.py`):
    `python test_installation.py` (This script should verify that all necessary libraries are installed and functioning correctly)

## Configuration

The framework can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`). The following environment variables are supported:

*   `LATENT_DIM`: The dimensionality of the latent space. (Default: 128)
*   `BATCH_SIZE`: The batch size used during training. (Default: 32)
*   `LEARNING_RATE`: The learning rate for the AAE and diffusion bridge models. (Default: 0.001)
*   `NUM_GENERATIONS`: The number of generations to run the evolutionary algorithm. (Default: 100)
*   `POPULATION_SIZE`: The size of the population used in the evolutionary algorithm. (Default: 50)
*   `FITNESS_FUNCTION`: The path to a Python file containing the custom fitness function. (Default: `fitness_functions/default_fitness.py`)

To use a configuration file, create a `config.yaml` file with the desired settings. The framework will automatically load the settings from this file if it exists.
Example `config.yaml`:
latent_dim: 256
batch_size: 64
learning_rate: 0.0005

## Usage

A basic example to train the AAE and evolve the latent space:
python train.py --config config.yaml --output_dir experiments/run_1
This command runs the training script using the configuration specified in `config.yaml` and saves the results in the `experiments/run_1` directory.

The main entry point for training and evolving the latent space is the `train.py` script. This script accepts several command-line arguments, including:

*   `--config`: The path to the configuration file.
*   `--output_dir`: The directory to save the results.
*   `--model_type`: Choose between 'tensorflow' or 'pytorch'
*   `--checkpoint`: The path to a checkpoint file to resume training from.
